# Support

## Maintainer Availability

`tz-player` is maintained by a single developer.

Maintenance is ongoing, but availability is limited and may vary significantly due to disability-related capacity constraints and other life obligations. Response times for issues, discussions, and pull requests can range from a few days to multiple months.

## What Support to Expect

- Best-effort support for bug reports and regressions.
- Best-effort triage of feature requests.
- No guaranteed response-time SLA.
- No guaranteed timeline for fixes or releases.

## Getting Help

For usage questions, bug reports, and feature requests, please open a GitHub Issue and include:

- your OS and Python version
- exact command(s) run
- relevant logs or traceback output
- clear reproduction steps

Reports with complete reproduction details are much easier to triage when maintainer time is limited.

## Pull Requests

Contributions are welcome. Small, focused PRs with tests and documentation updates are most likely to be reviewed and merged when maintainer capacity allows.
