Validation status:

- [x] `.ubuntu-venv/bin/python -m ruff check .`
- [x] `.ubuntu-venv/bin/python -m ruff format --check .`
- [x] `.ubuntu-venv/bin/python -m mypy src`
- [x] `.ubuntu-venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` (64 passed, 1 skipped)

Backlog status:

- [x] Workflow acceptance checklist added (`docs/workflow-acceptance.md`) and linked from `SPEC.md`.

Known remaining release tasks:

- [x] Update version/changelog for the release candidate.
- [x] Verify CI runs the same gate commands on PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Libraries

### Must Have (Release Blockers)

- [ ] Packaging & metadata: `pyproject.toml` complete, version updated, classifiers correct
- [ ] Configuration: no secrets in code, config defaults documented, env vars validated
- [ ] Input validation: public API guards invalid inputs and types
- [ ] Logging & observability: logging enabled with debug toggle; no noisy default logs
- [ ] Error handling & UX: clear error messages, no raw tracebacks by default
- [ ] Security basics: dependency review, safe file handling, path traversal checks
- [ ] Testing: unit tests for core API, negative/edge cases covered
- [ ] CI: lint + typecheck + tests on PR
- [ ] Release readiness: changelog updated, version tagged, artifacts build cleanly
- [ ] Docs: README quickstart + usage + troubleshooting

### Should Have (Strongly Recommended)

- [ ] Packaging: `twine check` passes; wheels build for supported Python versions
- [ ] Configuration: config file strategy with precedence (env > config > defaults)
- [ ] Input validation: defensive boundaries for sizes, limits, and formats
- [ ] Logging: optional file logging for debugging
- [ ] Testing: minimal integration tests against real workflows
- [ ] Maintenance: support policy and Python version policy stated

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Docs: API reference and more examples

## CLI Tools

### Must Have (Release Blockers)

- [ ] Packaging & metadata: console script entry point verified; `pipx` install works
- [ ] Configuration: env vars + config files documented; sane defaults

- [ ] Logging & observability: `--verbose` or debug toggle; log file option
- [ ] Error handling & UX: exit codes defined; no stack traces unless debug
- [ ] Security basics: safe file handling, temp directories, dependency review
- [ ] Testing: unit tests + CLI integration smoke tests
- [ ] CI: lint + typecheck + tests on PR
- [ ] Release readiness: changelog updated, version tagged, build artifacts verified
- [ ] Docs: README quickstart, usage examples, troubleshooting

### Should Have (Strongly Recommended)

- [ ] Configuration: config precedence and migration path documented
- [ ] Logging: structured-ish logs (key/value fields) for automation
- [ ] Testing: error-path tests and deterministic fixtures
- [ ] Maintenance: support window for Python versions

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Performance: startup time measured for large invocations
- [ ] Release: signed artifacts and automated release notes
- [ ] Docs: manpage or shell completions

## Desktop GUI Tools

### Must Have (Release Blockers)

- [ ] Packaging & metadata: packaging plan documented (wheel, installer, or bundler)
- [ ] Configuration: user settings stored in a safe location with defaults
- [ ] Input validation: defensive parsing for files and user input
- [ ] Logging & observability: log file option and debug toggle
- [ ] Error handling & UX: user-friendly dialogs; graceful fallback paths
- [ ] Security basics: safe file handling, temp directories, dependency review
- [ ] Testing: smoke tests for startup and critical flows
- [ ] CI: lint + typecheck + tests on PR
- [ ] Release readiness: changelog updated, versioned builds verified
- [ ] Docs: README setup + troubleshooting

### Should Have (Strongly Recommended)
