# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a private security advisory or email the maintainer at 15974146+taggedzi@users.noreply.github.com.
Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any impact assessment.

## Dependency Strategy

- Keep direct dependencies minimal and review new additions.
- Prefer version ranges with upper bounds for production deployments.
- Use `pip install --require-hashes` or a lockfile (e.g., `pip-tools`) for releases.

## Secrets and Sensitive Data

- Do not commit secrets or credentials to the repository.
- Use environment variables or OS keychains for secrets.
- Scrub logs and error messages that may include sensitive data.

## Safe File Handling

- Validate and normalize file paths before access.
- Avoid writing outside intended directories.
- Use atomic writes for critical files and handle permissions explicitly.
